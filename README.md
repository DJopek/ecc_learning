# ecc_learning
Since I'm very interested in math, Bitcoin and cryptography in general, I'm following in the footsteps of my friends [Kixunil](https://github.com/Kixunil/toy-secp256k1) and [KanoczTomas](https://github.com/KanoczTomas/bitcoin_playground) and learning the basics of elliptic curve cryptography by implementing it myself. Also, this is a great opportunity to understand Rust better, so it will be implemented in Rust.

**This is just a learning project, nothing to be used in production. You can use it in production, but at your own risk.**
